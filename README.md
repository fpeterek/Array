# array
Array class created using templates, don't use it

---

Just putting it here to show my classmates how to create an array using templates, you should't use it irl, use std::vector

The class is inefficient because it doesn't reserve that much memory and calls realloc fairly often. It's also missing a handful of methods 
that aren't necessary to display how templates work, but are useful in an actual array.
